A full-stack e-commerce application built with a focus on backend architecture, authentication, and role-based access control. This project serves as a comprehensive learning resource for scalable web development best practices.

## Overview

This application showcases a production-ready server-side implementation with two distinct user roles: **Customers** and **Owners**. While the UI is functional and responsive, the primary emphasis is on demonstrating proper backend architecture, security practices, and separation of concerns.


## Key Features

### Authentication & Security
- Industry-standard user authentication (signup/login)
- Session-based authentication with secure cookie management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with protected routes
- bcrypt password hashing for enhanced security
- JWT token implementation
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data

### Dual User Roles

**Customers Can:**
- Browse complete product catalog with detailed views
- Add items to cart and manage quantities
- Place and track orders
- View complete order history
- Update account information and preferences

**Owners Can:**
- Access comprehensive admin dashboard
- Full product management (create, update, delete)
- Inventory control and tracking
- Order management and fulfillment
- Analytics and reporting capabilities
